# powershellformatter README

As can be imagined; this extension provides a command voor VS code that will format a PowerShell document according to the TVS style guide.

## Features

When in a powershell document just press *CTRL+SHIFT+P* to bring up the command palette and type `Format Document` to execute the extension.

## Extension Settings

I will try to add some settings at some point in the future. (Yup. The classic #todo that's never going to happen)

## Known Issues

* There is no reasonable way to format function names just yet.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

Initial release. Does basically nothing but finds and replaces keywords and adds padding to brackets.
